<h1>EnvironmentMonitoring</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project aims to create a simple, open source environment optimisation tool for improved well-being. Temperature and humidity conditions directly impact bodily function. This system acts to recommend changes to improve environment for optimal bodily function and optimal feel.

<h2>What do we want to learn?</h2>
- We want the system to monitor the room and recommend a window state and heater dial.

<h2>What is the problem?</h2>
- The indoor and outdoor situations change, which makes it difficult to quantitatively moderate the ideal indoor climate.

<h2>Unanswered Project Questions:</h2>
- What is the best learning system to implement?
- How do we predict two variables using two different variables as inputs?
- Is it possible to predict these two variables given that one is binary and the other has a discrete range?
